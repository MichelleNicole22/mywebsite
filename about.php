    <p>I am a web designer and front-end developer based in Los Angeles, Ca. I became interested in web design 5 years ago when I took an online course on HTML. I was instantly hooked and knew right then what I wanted to do with the rest of my life.</p>

    <p>I spent as much time as I could teaching myself about HTML and CSS. I knew I needed to take it further if I was serious about becoming a web developer some day. That was when I decided to enroll at The Art Institute of Pittsburgh – Online Division. Going back to school was a wonderful choice.</p>

    <p>It is my mission to become a full-time front-end web developer, creating websites for small businesses and individuals</p>
